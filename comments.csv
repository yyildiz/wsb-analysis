"Why would you not attempt to use their site to do the same trades when tos fails?

If you are on your PC, then use the tdameritrade site to conudct trades when ToS fails.

Also, you can download both the tdameritrade app and the ToS app on an iphone or andriod device.

This means, when one doesn't work, you have 5 other options to conduct trades. This is, specifically, the value of tdameritrade above other platforms.

The retail brokers are all at war with each other, so expect everyone to be hit by something in rotating fashion.

Use more than one brokerage, also."

"While I agree to a certain extent, the existence of fractional shares counters the argument that the stock itself will be more accessible to the average investor after the split.

Regarding demand for options being priced in, I agree that there are $$$ traders trying to estimate the demand for TSLA calls when you can get a $1000c 10/2 for $2.31. Are they correct? Who knows!

Maybe it is ""usual supply and demand shit everyone knows"" but tons of people dropping $1,000 on a TSLA $1000c 1/15/2021 bringing up the whole chain is what I'm betting on."
Arbitration doesn't impact your right to seek recourse but instead makes it harder to get relief. Nonetheless OP has remedies through FINRA

They will let you switch your margin account to a cash account. But then they wont let you trade any options... So i just opened an account with a different broker.

Keeping it from a company that has paid $35 billion in fines for a diesel scandal and is still doing ok?  

With revenues of over 250 billion euro last year. and almost 20 billion in profit?  Volkswagen almost has more profit than tesla has revenue.

I'm not saying tesla has no place, but do you really, REALLY, believe that they can keep massive marketshare, growth and profit over VW?

If you were a battery manufacturer.. and you had 2 potential clients. One has maybe 8 billion cash reserves.. no real profit.. and has a range of 5 cars. Or another manufacturer with money coming out of their ears every year and 10 BRANDS in their portfolio.. who would you want to do a deal with?"

My only regret for CRM was not getting more üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Still trying to figure that out myself.  Likely to close out my positions tomorrow until I can see what the reaction is. It don't think is going to encourage big money to go cash gang though lol.
Nio‚Äôs not a meme stock at all. Chyna shit that can go belly up to feed the govt beast at any time but its def a legit af company that will probably hold a giant stale in the ev market within 3 years.
"lol I have some 515s, was thinking of doing the same.  Currently down 40%."
"SLV took me on quite a ride today, hoping it really breaks out tomorrow or Thursday. Playing with house money from last weeks AAPL and NVDA and todays FB but still"
I loss 2/3 of my investment between yesterday and today. I am diamond handing this because every time I sell my options the options immediately spike green.

"I have to ask... Is anyone else starting to get shit scared?

The SPY is officially higher than it was at the peak before the fall.

The SPY Growth is almost 10% higher than at the peak before the fall.

The DOW is down only around 6% from the all time highs.

The S&amp;P 500 is now above all time highs.

Even the TSX is only down around 7% from all time highs and the oil sector and other major industries of Canada got decimated..

We are seeing Warren Buffet go into Gold I never thought I would see the day (I know people are gonna do the standard quip but Buffet and Munger are beasts).

We are now seeing the trade volume hit all time lows on certain key areas.

We still have massive waves from COVID in areas of employment, debt, inflation/deflation, business closure, bankruptcy, massive inequality of savings/wealth.

We have certain segments blown up to the point that when I look at the charts I don't even think ""bubble"" is an accurate term. The charts literally give me cancer they are so intense to look at.

I love pa pa elon just like everyone but the fact that this short squeeze has taken us to around 1900 is insane. Guys this is over 100% on top of the short squeeze from last time and they are down this quarter in actual revenue.

This may all keep going on for more time than I could ever imagine. Maybe a year or even more but man I am so worried that some people are gonna lose everything when this bursts.

For god sakes away from the memes for a second and our fun ass phrases please please be careful that you aren't going over what you can handle if this reverses.

We have already seen how some main stocks can go down 60-80% once they start falling in a month and how the whole indexes can fall almost 50% in a month and a half.

Guys be careful, for real."

"Oh, I'm not doubting that not being able to close a position quickly is a problem. It absolutely is a problem, and definitely a black eye for your broker.

It's just that if you're going to trade where you want to quickly scalp in and out you can't use a large portion of your portfolio to do it because it makes you personally overleveraged like OP because of the platform risk. Even if it works out a bunch of times, you will eventually wreck your portfolio because of volatility."

"Another lesson here is you need the phone number and your account info to call and have them close your positions over the phone. Like everyone used to do back in the day. Power could go out. Apps could break. Internet go down etc.

"That CRM beat and pump was all i needed to see. About a two years ago CRM had a huge beat and surged, before the market even opened the next day CRM pissed away all its gains and the market overall slid hard. I said omg just my fucking luck. I was a fresh new fish swimming in a tide that was much too strong. 

Exactly one year later I decided to play CRM ER again. Huge beat sky and skyrocketed. The day after that? The infamous Trump Tweet day where he warned all american companies to find alternative supply chains to China and consider bringing their operations to America. The market dipped very hard and CRM was a casualty. 

I have been keeping tabs on CRM as I always use their products for work and like to see how it does. Not kidding, for the past two years (8 ERS) the day after CRM ER is a big red day for the market. 

This is my DD. Tomorrow is going to be rough."

But there is zero surprise in that and it's having a pre-earnings run."
I held 8/21 MSFT 215c and DKNG 40c for over 2 months waiting for a pump so I could get out at least breaking even and they didn't move an inch. 2 days after the expire worthless both companies pump. WTF is that all about? HOW?

"Fidelity fucked me over when I tried to sell 250 shares of a stock as it was crashing. I placed a limit sale on the Fidelity Active Trader Pro app and it got stuck on pending. The stock kept crashing past my limit and so I called Fidelity to ask why it was stuck in pending. 

Their support team apparently didn't know how the Active Trader Pro app worked and that I need to place trades on the website instead... I didn't end up losing a whole bunch of money because I had a low cost basis, but still... wtf!?"
CRM AH is making my PP hard
OK INTU

"At both my last job and current job, I literally am the guy you talk to when you request a supervisor. And these jobs are at the 2 largest firms. I have a 7, 63, 9, 10. I literally take these verbal complaints all day. They are not filed nor required to be filed. One thing you learn on the 9/10 is that firms can put their own policies and rules on top of the minimum rules, so it‚Äôs possible your firm has additional rules on top of what is required. But I can absolutely tell you that filing verbal complaints is not required by firms, and that is in the study material for the 9/10. I can prove my claims of where I work to a mod if you‚Äôd like. This isn‚Äôt a good hill to die on, you‚Äôre just wrong."
"These ""people"" after next week aren't going to force a delivery, those people left are major banks, they don't want to pay stupid storage fees or withdrawal fees and if they ever have to put the silver back its not cheap. It is much easier to hold an electronic contract that does the same."

"Never mind the other auto makers. Market cap has now passed Wal-Mart and is approaching J&amp;J. Two companies that have been making obscene amounts of money for decades, compared to a company whose core operations has yet to turn a profit, and only makes a little money selling EV credits that will not continue.

Gotta love 2020."
"How much did you make?  ;)

The IV is high so I was looking for a play and found this thread.  Not sure I want to touch it now."
Foghats
"Literally can't pick a winning position. Every single thing I bought traded sideways today.

Bought AAPL, NVDA, TSLA at the dip yesterday all are bleeding so fucking hard."
"Live by the theta, die by the theta"

"No, I‚Äôm a big ball chad brother."
"&gt; Tesla can very well may be again at 5k after split in the next 5 years

Assuming Tesla freezes all additional issuance of shares (including compensation or funding). Then a 5k stock price post spit would mean a $4.6 Trillion market cap. 

Realistically given that Tesla is a capital intensive biz. They won't buy back shares, AND they will probably increase outstanding share # by at least 20%. 

So most likely what you're saying is a $6+ Trillion market cap. lol this level of widespread delusion tempts me to short."

"It‚Äôs not till sept 15, it might correct a little then moon again for earnings week"
I'm guessing it's too late to buy CRM? Their financials are good and they're getting a nice index pop but probably too late to get in now?

"Once you realize that the stock market is a casino/club run for and by the wealthy, and that 90% of all stocks are owned by the rich/*very* rich, then you realize that the stock market does not care that poor people are hurting, and it will continue to go up and leave them behind."

"Yeah this is why I was bailing when I did. I didn't time the top perfectly and definitely left some cash on the table but was more than satisfied with what I got. The main thing that people seem not to understand is the significance of these ETFs following the movement of the underlying index, not the value. So in this case JNUG was still down 70% or more from where it was pre pandemic, but the underlying index had finished recovering, this was my sign to bail as there wasn't going to be any more upwards momentum. I didn't predict there would be a random run on gold that would push the gold mining stocks to record highs though. I caught the first part of the run but it was getting a little too dicey for me so I cashed out.

I think what you got at in your first comment is entirely right. People are forgetting what the essence of this sub is. It's a bunch of people taking bets on the market and knowingly taking on risk for the chance of greater rewards. It's now become people who don't understand the implements they're trading, throwing cash at whatever the sub's general sentiment supports, and occasionally thinking they're the next Buffet for finding some amazing trade that ultimately bites them in the ass because they were completely wrong about it in the first place."

Kia, Honda, and Hyundai are all starting to put them out as well which will cut into the Model 3‚Äôs and Model Y‚Äôs market.

"The government is spending money it doesn't have like crazy.  That's what's up.  The government is still paying its contractors, still increasing benefits transfers, and still subsidizing the shit out of farmers and what else?  'Rona Checks."
"From what I gather: both puts AND calls will see increased demand that will push the price of both up relative to their pre-split value / intrinsic value / whatever-options-pricing-model-you-use value. It's not a zero sum game, puts and calls can both be overpriced. 

As an aside, I think people with less money will be more inclined to buy calls to try to hop on the proverbial ""gravy trains"" that are TSLA &amp; AAPL Summer of Love 2020 returns."

"It‚Äôs losing ground in the auto space for sure. That said I wouldn‚Äôt count it out just yet. 

While cameras are taking the lead, most systems use a combination of sensors for redundancy. Even Teslas use radar in combination with their cameras. NVIDIA blends cameras, radar, and lidar. If you‚Äôre bullish on Luminar‚Äôs system, I think that‚Äôs the best case for it, being integrated into a composite system.

All that said, all around prices for lidar are coming down, and I think any commercial vehicle is going to have 360 degrees of lidar coverage. The cost is so minimal relative to the price of those vehicles."
Why not put in the work and get more cash to bring to the table... With $100 it is possible to make some gains with it but you are still very limited and is just not worth it. Doesn't take that much work to get $1000 go work a second job if you are willing to really work hard to lose money here.

"It has viable products sure, but whether their balance sheet is how they report is another question. They are setting themselves up as a lifestyle type brand, so slightly different to Tesla. I like the stock, but not at this price without a catalyst - it was the China talks going well speak that got it here, we all know how quickly that can go, which is why I bought puts at what I think is the top. Long term bullish, short term bearish for retracement when Trump tweets something stupid."

"I don't know what to tell you except that I do this for a living, and yes they are filed. But that is nothing tangible for the customer unlike a written complaint which would warrant a written response and written records retained, so it makes sense to me that they would tell you to write it up. Firms still have a requirement to supervise their reps beyond written record keeping requirements and I guarantee you that any allegation of wrongdoing made verbally does not just get tossed aside just because you didn't write it down (unless your BD is shady/incompetent as all fuckoff), it just doesn't necessarily come out in a tangible or useful form for the customer making the complaint. Especially if their final answer to your complaint was essentially ""You're wrong and stupid, and we're not giving you shit""."

I‚Äôve also lived in Hawaii where they phased out most AirBNBs in residential areas because rental investors were making it impossible for there to be housing inventory for local workers.

Buy AAPL dip now
The problem is the good ole staircase up elevator down. You played it well but these vehicles aren't really meant for long holds and have a decay factor. In most market conditions you will lose more than you win from long holding leveraged ETFs. Obviously this doesn't mean you cant make money with them. I'd compare it to the people who purchased TSLA 2000c back in June. Of course they made money with the trade but that is going to lose more often than it wins.

"To continue the party analogy, they got in early and have a table next to the secret exit. They don't know when the party will end anymore than anyone else but they tipped the bartender (RH) enough that they tell them when the drink orders slow, and they'll head for the door once they know it's starting to run out of steam. They'll also have an influencer (MSNBC) on call to go and prime another spot so when they leave party 1 they can get the table they want at party 2. If it takes too long to start the party or they get bored, they call up their hookup and get strippers (Fed and the repo) or drugs (stimulus) to get things revved up."

One owner cancelled and wouldn‚Äôt willingly refund my money which ended with him getting kicked off the site 2 weeks later. Total headaches.

Best luck I‚Äôve had is dealing with VRBO hosts directly and booking through region specific rental agencies. Same prices if not cheaper than AirBNB and I don‚Äôt have to worry about a bunch of flakes cancelling my reservation at the last minute."

I am with you but I yolo'd the last of my portfolio. Yesterday....so I in spirit bought the dip today.
I swear JPOW if you announce something stupid like ‚Äúgonna lift the rates a bit‚Äù ima beat yo ass &gt;:(
"buyer and seller each have their reasons, not too much info from this imo"
Just happened to me with ups
Only needs to recover two weeks of losses to be ITM!
I am amazed that the media or people arent complaining about it. It seems both sides really didnt even want to pass it and made them selves look like the good guys in this
who tf is investing in cruise companies right now hahah
"Yeah that seems like a safe strategy.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one but I have a feeling the second I try to get some free money it‚Äôll tank.

Maybe I roll into fb calls

"1) Tesla mainly cares about global EV market which, yes, will grow dramatically for decades. Tesla‚Äôs solar/storage business is also expected to grow. 

2) Tesla‚Äôs global EV market share in Q1 was 29%. They don‚Äôt even need more market share.

3) Tesla‚Äôs automotive margins were 25.5% in Q1. BMW was 3.3%. Tesla sold an $8,000 software package to 1/4 of its customers. The price of that package will grow as no one can compete with Tesla‚Äôs FSD computer, neural net, and data set. CyberTruck will be produced at 1/5 CapEx of Ford‚Äôs F-150. So yeah, their margins will be stupidly higher and continue to grow.

This isn‚Äôt even getting into Tesla‚Äôs insurance, storage/solar, trucking/logistics, TBC loops, and ride-share businesses or the possibility of a robotaxi.

*The big picture is that human mobility will be revolutionized this century: total transition to electric vehicles, development of a sustainable grid to power the vehicles (solar/storage/charging), and full self-driving capabilities will have a dramatic impact on society like the smartphone. Tesla is positioned to be a leader in that revolution, BMW is not."

AAPL closing around 499.92 and then pumping over 500 ah
what does this mean
Why tho?
What do you mean?  It's flat still. Am I missing something?

So how much does it need to shoot up to retain the value
"Only people that should be considering selling is 8/28 call holders who bought yesterday morning, and even then the losses are so bad that you might as well diamond hand until EOW and see if you get something back"
"I think you got the technicalities of COMEX market wrong! First of all, for Sep futures where there are 50,000 open interest, the silver can be delivered any time during the month of Sep (if they are not rolled over) and the short determines when to deliver. I agree that there's some chance of squeeze if more longs ask for delivery, but it's very unlikely to happen at the start of the month. Anyway, good luck!"

"Got word from my hubby's gf, she's saying to buy TSLA or APPL, otherwise, you aint black"
I really want a UVXY position but they are rolling from Sept to Oct contract which has a huge spread.  I'd either wait or get a signal the markets are crashing.
thanks for heads up
"Yeah, these are more of a weekly/monthly thing or overnight thurs to Fri. 

They don't have the liquidity of Spy calls so you lose the spread every time you sell, so it's tough to day-trade / flip LULU calls if the stock is only +/- a dollar in the channel.  There were the 2 days when the NASDAQ hit record highs intra-day and then proceeded to crash back into oblivion, and those were fine days to flip lulu calls, but nothing like that has happened lately."

It'll definitely repeat after the election running into earnings in December.  I'm going to be holding a lot more options through the December earnings call than I am through this September earnings call

Same. If NIO opens red tomorrow I fkd
"I bought 2750 shares at $4.8, then it split so 275 shares at $48. Sold most of it at $100 then went into long options for Jan 2021 at $195, then jumped out a few weeks ago, before this current fall. Could have been a little better though, I was about a week too early to hit the top, but better to bail before the top then wait until the bottom. Before this shit I was -50% all time, now I'm passing +400%. I got lucky as all I did for DD was look at a JNUG meme, then saw that it had fallen super hard and thought  ""Surely it will go back up.""

Also you're math is way wrong. 1400 shares at $10 before the split is 140 shares at $100. JNUG is sitting at $138 right now so you'd be sitting on 138x140 = $19,320, with a profit of $5,320. If you'd been a boomer and listened to all the analysts saying to just buy normal companies that were down at that time you would have made much the same money. If you'd bought APPL during the dip for lets say $250 (it went lower than this but lets play it safe) you would have been sitting on $28,000 right now, so 2.5x the profits."

"I wasn't clear, I was talking about the people who own those contracts, since it all depends on what they do. Whoever shorted can just keep writing paper, and those who want to delivery can get it, JPM holds half the silver in comex. They don't care, they can play both sides.

Honestly, I don't know anything. There is also a ton of volume for september. But they probably have a far larger picture than any of us could predict with what we are able to know. And it's probably them that's going to profit. Too many unknowns."
"Hmmm, those covered calls i sold earlier today on AMD are -320 percent. O well profit is profit."
The greed takes over when you are already 300% up and the earnings are coming up which are expected to be good.

"Tesla will STEAL market share from everyone.  They already are.  The Model 3 is outselling all the midsized luxury cars in its class.  Combined.  They have 80% of US  market share of EVs and are no longer getting Federal tax credits as other manufacturers are.  This amounts to a $7,500 price disadvantage.

The margins of electric cars \*will be\* much better than ICE.  Right now it is close to parity, but remember in 2012, it was nearly $1,000 per kWh for the battery.  Now it is closer to $100.  The cost per kWh and other performance metrics of the batteries are improving at \~7% per year.  The curve will continue to bend and Tesla will eat the other MFG's lunch.  The market sees this as the most likely outcome.  Could it be wrong?  Sure.  I don't think it is though."

No worries. I‚Äôll get you that purple lambo you‚Äôve been asking for when AAPL is at $3000 tomorrow.
"&gt; Ok then, help me understand exactly how tesla is going to become a company that valuable.

By all but cornering the market on electric vehicles. No ICE manufacturer has vertical integration and the deals that Tesla is making with CATL, Panasonic and LG means that the other manufacturers only get the leftovers.

Look at the GM NJ battery plant and its expected output 30MWh -- and it's not open for years. Tesla will be at 1000MWh by then.

tl:dr: They're fucked, that's why."

Now, if none of their COVID solutions work out, there's always their original pipeline for pain/cancer, etc. However, of course, those are likely much longer term.

But there's potential upside here. It's just been a highly volatile stock recently."

"I think you are way high on your estimate of battery cost at the pack level.  The SR model 3 is using Iron Phosphate batteries and it has been reported that the cost of the cells is $60/kWh.  SR+ Model 3 has a \~55kWh Battery.  Assuming the pack level cost is 2x the cell cost (which is likely an overestimate) a $120/ kWh pack times 55 kWh = $6600 

Tesla is famously close-lipped about the cost per kWh for the battery, maybe we find out on 9/22, but many sources have reported costs approaching $130 at the pack level in the last year, so I feel confident that the pack is less than $10k on the battery in the SR+ 3."

"That's what I'm thinking.

Plus, eh, yah why not, maybe he'll scare the bejeesus out of everyone and say their new inflation target is like 10% or something - that wouldn't hurt.

I guarantee you JP morgan is going to be bombing DXY in order to lower SLV prices. This is basically a fight between evil and.... whatever we are. I like our chances. If there's every a week to throw the kitchen sink at this fight, it's this one. (Potentially next one, but eh, I'd still pick this one - obviously)"

It‚Äôs hard for Reddit users to understand because Reddit tends to be a little tech savvy, but the vast majority of people are borderline brain dead when it comes to technology.  Apple has basically monopolized simple technology which is the most valuable thing to own in their sector.

Think about how completely lost your parents would be if they ever switched to android.  Think about how lost some of your friends would be if they ever switched.  Comparability and synchronization is why Apple will reign supreme for a very long time.

And frankly when it comes to text messaging, they basically monopolized that too considering no one wants anything to do with a group chat that isn‚Äôt full of apple users."

Will the demand be there? To me the number of vehicles produced worldwide each year will be flat in the next 10 years or even get lower. Let's assume ICE cars are phase out in favour of electric cars: Will Tesla be able to compete against the top German car makers? What's TESLA's competitive advantage against them??
Look at the graph for the last 3 months. Its fucking disgusting

"Absolutely not priced in. 

Apple silicon, right now, is only understood by tech nerds (like me), tech sites, and YouTubers. 

People don‚Äôt seem to understand, or rather, care - that Apples silicons will be on par and even beat some of Intels high end processors - with only passive cooling. 

Consumers as a whole don‚Äôt care about the Geekbench numbers, how the TDP of Apple chips will be far and away more efficient and more powerful, per watt than Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm‚Äôs offerings. 

What people care about is Price, battery life, efficient, longevity, and ease of use. All of which are yet to be seen with Apples own silicon (in Macs at least)

When they come out with their new line up, IT WILL shake the market. A processor that can outscore an i9 - in a thin and light without cooling that can last 24hours - WHILE MAINTAINING Thunderbolt 3 (Apple co-invented this port with Intel) 

When people can reap the benefits of what Apple is bringing out without even knowing what is really happening.

Mix all this with Apples marketing, and their seemingly magic ability to create a need, and their seamless integration with all the products, then yeah, the market will react and the market will reflect that, AND THEN it‚Äôll be priced in.

"Take the profits at easy 130% then. You need profit goals planned when you make the buy, everyone knows the loss can ride (unless you're stupid and bought on margin).

30% gains is reasonable for any investment so if you catch a rocket that you've been waiting on for 1.5-2 months, lock in the five or tenbagger unless theres still 2+ months to go. If the underlying was going to keep going up, you can find a good buy, but take time to judge the sentiment and be realistic in the new target. 

If you're good enough to make 30% gains, you turn 1k into 1bil in 52 trades (not counting taxes). No, you're not going to make 30% every week and become a billionaire in a year, but it gives you the idea of how important reasonable goals are."
I‚Äôm out of day trades and up 230% on my NIO call from this morning. Hopefully there is a decent amount of people who hold over to tomorrow.

"AAPL presents a very good lesson in why you should never buy FDs. All of you autists who bought 8/28 contracts, especially OTM contracts, probably got wiped today even with the pump.

Don't think I would run with a short or put position though, the float is still bigly owned by the institutions.  Not many retail holders out there.  That's a recipe to hurt the shorts/put buyers royally.

Nah I was up but didn't sell like a dummy on those spy puts. Just got stop lossed out. Put the rest into AAPL hoping for a gap up this week :/
How much money do you have to spare? If any try scalping amazon or Tesla for weeklies. You can bring back up your portfolio if you scalp 50% delta options for 10% profit each time.
"Yeap, he‚Äôs corner himself into a kind of big problem. The inflation guidance policy was put in place to raise the credibility of the fed since monetary policy is only effective if expected inflation moves along the signals from the fed. Now he is ‚Äútweaking it‚Äù so as to allow him to run inflation higher but in doing so he may be denting the credibility of the fed."
I‚Äôve seen too many stocks get upgrades and the inverse happens. Upgrades don‚Äôt mean shit. Plus.. it went from sell to neutral. Not really a stellar upgrade. I‚Äôll be looking for the top of this pump and riding down on puts

"Retard shepherds are selling them on the open market. How to price options is a valuable thing to study on your own time if you plan to trade them, so you can intelligently pick entries/exits as a buyer, or price them correctly as a seller."
real talk the feeling of warm buttery euphoria you get when you actually make a right call and you make a few hundred / thousand in a day is honestly better than sex.
The only thing I hate about RKT is that during the day it takes stairs up and elevator down and it only moves after hours so all the gains get wiped in 5 min

Also an airbnb host. Since the lockdowns were lifted I'm back to being always booked and the only difference I'm noticing is a trend towards longer stays. My house is in an ivy league college town and this dude rented my house for his son's college semester. THE ENTIRE SEMESTER.

"Thanks bro, I entered 380/385 calls for this Friday on the bottom of this dip. Profit potential is 231%, which is funnily enough exactly what I had in my old 495/500 call spread in AAPL before I rolled it up to 510/515. So I basically reentered the exact same position, but I feel like LULU has more room to run. AAPL feels like its being pinned below 500."

"Yes and No.  The problem with ACI is that they are not competitive long term.  They will post 2-3 quarters that are artificially high due to COVID and then struggle to hit earnings. ACI business model is not relevant in the coming years and consumers are shifting from accepting of high/low to EDLP retailers.   Mass retailers and dollar chains are performing exceedingly well (reference TGT and DG).  I like you, thought COVID was enough to carry weaker grocery retailers stock up in the short term, but there is not enough confidence that ACI has a reason to maintain share coming out of this."

"I thought they handled this in New York State pretty well. NYS has a room occupancy tax for hotels, and early on in airbnb's history it was the airbnb hosts' responsibility to keep track of and pay this tax to NYS, supposedly in 4 installments throughout the year. You can imagine how well that went. Airbnb was pretty smart and preemptively started collecting room tax for all airbnb bookings in NYS so that it's all done automatically and hosts don't have to worry about anything except reporting airbnb income for state income taxes as usual."
Whats the move?

"Even then, whether it's written or verbal, all they have to do is file the complaint. If the firm considers the matter resolved and already gave you their final answer, they're going to send you a letter saying so and call it a day.

A complaint will still put it on paper, but that absolutely does not mean that their answer will change, or that someone ""higher"" in the organization will have to review it.

The real answer is just to call in right away and get your attempted trade documented. Based on the fact that they paid out OP, it sounds like the first manager he talked to did not know at the time that this was a widespread issue, or also possible that OP didn't describe the issue in a way that warranted correction, and later on they did their own research and made everyone whole. Or of course, the manager may have just fucked up and didn't offer resolution when he obviously should have."

It's okay i'm okay with the loss it was a gamble and i wrote it off before i even bought it, it's like 15% of my port whatever i will recover.  What i need help with is figuring out how much TSLA stock has to go up for me to break even? like if tsla goes to 2200 by say wed or thursday, is that enough to make my contract move or am i fucked due to theta no matter what price tsla goes to? unless it hits 2366.77 which is my break even price?  

Overall what are my odds of surviving my autist move. 1% ? i'm praying to like six different Gods right now. I just have a hard time figuring out if i have a 1% chance or a 10% chance, how bad is my situation?"

"I think you‚Äôre missing the point.

"Powell scheduled to talk this week, is expected to say that the Fed will pursue ""average inflation"" in which it's allowed to go above 2% for a while to make up for the time it was below 2%.  


Thing is though, it's irrelevant. Inflation is *not* above 2%, and it hasn't been for years and years. Just look at the data.  [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/)   


Inflation was at 2.3% before the pandemic and then took a plunge. I would not expect it to get  back to 2% for quite some time. That would require people to actually buy shit other than stocks."

"Did you get the names and id numbers of all the phone reps who you spoke to?  FINRA disciplinary committees take this very seriously especially if you say the reps were rude or  used foul language with you.  

I had gotten a FINRA rep fired before at a brokerage - at first I felt bad about it but then decided he had it coming for dropping f bombs at me on the phone.  

His U4 is ruined.  It's like having a criminal record on file - but less severe in some ways - more severe in others.  B/c anyone can look it up on FINRA broker check and it never goes away even after the rep is no longer affiliated with the industry."

I don't use Schwab for my up-to-the-minute stock news. Usually WSB breaks stories or CNBC a minute after it happens. I've had a glitch/technical problem once or twice and you bet your ass they worked to address it immediately. I don't know how people play with Robinhood. If you're trading options then the miniscule transaction price to ensure the play goes through is worth every penny.

"I started my ""trading"" on Robinhood and after getting screwed by outages, I tried TD/ToS, and Schwab. I also recently opened a Merrill account and was less than impressed. Schwab is by and large the best of them all. Their mobile app isn't the sexiest, but it has all the information you could ask for and just works. Their customer service is also on point. I have full confidence I could call in a trade for some reason the app was down. 

Also I prefer the Schwab desktop app over Merrill and TD. Biggest selling point is the ability to watch CNBC in the Schwab app so I can listen to Cramer ramble as I lose money..."

It is literally illegal to pump a stock you own the way that he did.
"PRPL was a shit company.

DHS Matt pumped it after it basically died on him. Stayed flat. His saving grace was that his options were several months ahead. He dropped several DDs in the meantime. I don't blame him. Its the buyers fault for buying options and stock in a company they know nothing about."
Hopefully AAPL goes up bigly by then
No
"For all areas of commodities : the are slow moving b/c they are 1) international thus controlled my multiple countries and 2) respond to supply and demand.   Silver is not rising b/c by investing in SLV you are in a bank's assets which they can and are manipulating. Their time to do so is running out hence SLV is not drilling to the core of the earth. 

And, the Norse have no power here. On WSB we worship the Greeks. Pffft, fuck a one-eyed , fat man :P."

"why would AAPL or TSLA moon for the rest of the week?

&amp;#x200B;

The shareholders getting the split were in last Friday so why would people run up TSLA this week?

Replace TSLA with AAPL and it's the same story.

What's stopping MM from dropping the stocks now the hype is gone so they don't pay out so many 5-1 as it would have been on the 21st. In additon to doing so all the FOMO from the last 100-200 point climb would be pointless to hold if it drops 5% cause they could rebuy when it splits and it would be the exact same."

"Absolutely man. EPL nowadays are when the ECL felt back then. So many teams had real legitimate shot to win the title. And back then, champions league used two-cycle 4-team group stages, most of the time the second group stage would pit a lot of good teams against each other, home and away. That was fantastic for soccer/football fans despite taxing for the players."

Many independents UNFI/SuperValu services are seeing record high foot traffic and claim to be beating remaining market. This is mirrored across consumption on many GM/HBC brands.

Many GM/HBC vendors are seeing DEEP double digits growth VS. YA. While most independents serviced via UNFI lack sophistication in supply chain, buying power, and digital services... They've benefits from consumer habits over COVID and a decrease in foot traffic in industry leading retailer Walmart drove consumers to their stores.

UNFI will beat projections, but I do not believe they are a long term play with most independents lacking the ability to evolve and remain competitive in the future. WholeFoods relevant GM/HBC most likely have a direct relationship with Amazon with no benefit of eroding margin to a third party distributor."

I'm gonna have to assume you're going off of market cap and not share price, even though you don't mention market cap anywhere. Even though Robinhood says their market cap is about $3 billion, it's actually $80 billion due to the IPO shares only representing 5% of the company. 

Motley Fool is retarded but their comparison to Penny Mac is pretty helpful in understanding why their IPO price had to be reduced from $24 to $18.

&amp;#x200B;

This article was published when RKT was around $22 per share. If it was overvalued at $22, the only way you can justify $30+ is meme stock rules. I'm not saying it won't happen, but counting on it to moon further ""just because"" is a bad investment strategy.

If stocks hits 177.5 or higher I make 1300$ 300 from 3 dollar jump plus 1,000$ from premium. I miss out on any further gains though. If it goes down I keep the premium and get only lose money if BA drops below 164.50 as the 1,000$ premium covers that cost. Is there any holes in this strategy. Except obviously if BA just tanks, I plan on holding for long term though. And I plan to repeat the strategy monthly"

"# Breaking -- TEVA Charged fFor Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe 

U.S. Poised to Charge Teva in Generic Drugs Price-Fixing Probe

Aug. 25, 2020, 2:16 PM

U.S. prosecutors are preparing to charge Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. with conspiring with competitors to raise prices for generic drugs, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Justice Department is planning to charge Teva as soon as Tuesday after the company rebuffed a settlement that would have required paying a criminal penalty and admitting wrongdoing, said the person, who declined to be named because the matter is confidential.

A spokesperson for Teva, which is based in Israel, declined to comment.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/igi7yn/breaking\_teva\_charged\_ffor\_generic\_drugs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/igi7yn/breaking_teva_charged_ffor_generic_drugs/)"

"I can pay my bills, transfer money to RH and TOS, and do countless other in app payment processing tasks via other apps from Apple‚Äôs store (without using apple‚Äôs payments), but Epic is barred from that feature?

"Volume has died the last 2 weeks(after free money ended). In line with Walmart and Bestbuy reactions. Buy puts the night before earnings. Has run too much. Earnings will be a 10% haircut.

Any tickers you guys recommend for intra day trading? MY spy and spx are flat as ever. I was thinking intra day trading apple since it has large ranges in a given day along with tight big and ask prices. What do you guys recommend?
Boy you nuttier than squirrel shit. I like you
calls or puts? I'm thinking about puts eod.
Not beating yourself up for 'missing profit' is a huge step forward. Take your money and look to the next play.
TSLA and AAPL frozen
"It‚Äôs absolutely mind boggling indeed. But I think that‚Äôs a better career choice than Ronaldo moving to Italy from a rational standpoint. He always played quite well against PL teams recently also.

On the rivalry side of things. Historically red and blue ain‚Äôt even really that big of a pair of rivals lol. Leeds being back has lots of United fans pumped, at least those local ones. I for one enjoy KDB and Silva playing."
jerome powell might print behind the scenes but he is gonna dump the shit out of this on thurs

Not
me too fuckin Will Meade. Its down 40% in two weeks. Hasnt had a green day since.
why are RKT calls so expensive??
CRM done going up or are we diamond hands through earnings
Silver was always long term play based on market fundamentals. You should be ready to hold until late October minimum. Even 2021. A lot of people are not going to be ready for silver's volatility and will lose money in the process.
"I switched over after the Robinhood crash lost me 600 fucking $ and went to the more professional trading program. Schwab is phenomenal in the fact it‚Äôs got everything, news, chart, technical tools, analysts takes on the stock you‚Äôre looking at, bid/ask price data which is great for intraday trading and most importantly they are phenomenal at filling orders, I‚Äôll sell my options at the ask side and almost always get filled even when the stock is trending the other direction. They gun to fill those orders. My only gripe with them is that I feel on the news tab they are too late with the news, robinhood and yahoo finance do a great job of getting the news out right away where as schwab lags behind them by an hour or so, and secondly their mobile app sucks, the design of it, it‚Äôs so clunky and harder to execute trades while you‚Äôre on the go, but that‚Äôs not a big problem since I‚Äôm trading from my laptop about all the time."

It's harder to trade options in the uk, you have to open a US account and I've avoided it because of the fees."

They are a 10 year old company, show me one treatment they have that they did not abandon to move on to something else that was currently paying. What is their closest product to market?

"My reply to the last person shilling this:

There's a reason the shares have barely moved, they're paying a lot of money for this company trying to make budget lidar.

Velodyne is a better company with a top of the line product, with applications outside the autonomous vehicle space, and yet these two somehow have the same valuation? Oh they have a deal with Volvo? Velodyne is already selling an actual product to Boeing.

Luminar's selling point is being cheaper, but guess what, you need four units to cover the same field of view as traditional lidar. They also claim it can see farther (traditional lidar can damage the human eye, which means they have to keep the power lower, while luminar uses a non-harmful frequency) but why does a self driving car give a shit whats beyond 250m? They don't."

"I feel that I have reached a Zen moment in my trading career: I no longer feel the need to look at the performance of stuff I am out of because it's just a waste of time.

"I have had problems with TD mobile platform since the merger was arranged. I have another account on Robinhood Really don't know why. And both Robin Hood  and. Td platforms have had problems. There were times I couldn't even check my account. They are both screw ups. And the only thing that will make them change is when a major class action lawsuit  Is brought against them. Then they'll wake up pay a few million and it'll be all redundancy all over again.  Seems to me once they start to proliferate in dollars their service becomes denigrated. All these companies especially in this terrible time the country is going through should be overcompensating ,over servicing  you, but instead it seems like lack of service is the new normal. 
But I will say when I do use Phone contact to talk to a representative they are informed and knowledgeable and very helpful."

"As someone who works in the industry, I know that UNFI was plagued with out-of-stock inventory issues due to manufacturer OOS during the panic buying earlier this year, and it's to my understanding that this is still somewhat of an issue. I'm guessing that probably cut into revenues. I've also heard that Amazon is looking into using in-house logistics to handle things and will eventually pivot away from using UNFI. EarthFare and Lucky's Market grocery chains (both UNFI customers) also went out of business in the last few months, so that could also impact UNFI results.

Maybe these things have already been priced in, maybe not. Hope that helps a little bit."

There are some things to be noted about the company: (my opinion, do your own DD and I take no fault in following this advice or inverse this if you wish, I don't care)

* They made an investment into Zoom but pulled out weeks ago (don't think it'll be in this quarters ER).
* People claiming that it'll skyrocket but it has already gone up 20% from last quarter. What exactly did CRM do these past months to warrant the ER report to push it even further? It's already priced in. 
* Companies have already made the switch to online last quarter and the economy is waking back up again so I don't expect an even larger push towards switching to an online format. 
* Don't expect the price to drop 10-15% tomorrow. Expect maybe something measly 1-5%.
* Don't be a tard and hold the puts forever cause CRM is always growing bigger every year. I enjoyed the calls I made before this ER and I'll do it again for next ER."

I'm 90% tech as well. I leave about 15-20% of my portfolio for swing trades on social trends. Right now my swing trade is Beacon Roofing Supply $BECN for a hurricane trade. They're one of the biggest roofing companies in the country and have performed well during other natural disaster scenarios. My other swing trades are SWBI and RUN for election trades. Both have done very well for me so far. Got into BECN yesterday.

Calls on KFC confirmed
Thank you NIO. You are beautiful.
"I‚Äôm going to ignore the coming AAPL stock split so as to avoid inconsistencies in the following:

You are correct. Somebody made a contract with you, where they are obligated to sell you 100 shares of AAPL for the price of $500. The contract expires after Oct 16, but anytime before it expires, you can make the seller fulfill their contract. The contract stays in effect no matter what the price of AAPL is at. So, if AAPL is trading higher than 500, the person who sold you the contract is still obligated to sell at that price. If AAPL is trading at 600 before expiry, you could ‚Äúexercise‚Äù your contract which means you are telling the person who sold you it, that you would like to purchase the 100 shares you are entitled to at $500 a piece, and then you turn around and sell the shares on the open market for $600 a piece, meaning you made profit (your profit = $60,000 - $50,000 - original premium you paid for the contract). Let‚Äôs say the stock never goes above $500 by the expiry date of Oct 16, your contract would expire worthless because you would not exercise the contract and buy 100 shares for the price of $500 a piece if they are available on the open market for $490 a piece. 

The person who sold you this contract is taking on risk, for the price of the premium you pay him for the contract. The seller is hoping that AAPL stock does not go above $500 a share by the time the contract expires, and they simply receive the premium you paid them originally for the contract without having to sell you any shares.

Now realistically, if AAPL stock increases past $500, and you have time left on the contract, you can simply sell the options contract to the open market for a higher price, instead of having to personally ‚Äúexercise‚Äù it. If you sell the contract to the open market, the new owner has the option to exercise it at the $500 strike price, or hold onto it and hope AAPL stock increases even more before the contract expires."

Judging by the reaction to the DNC and now RNC, I believe Mr. Market isn't too concerned with the upcoming election and we probably won't see that much in terms of election jitters volatility. Since 1992, the American voter seems pretty content alternating between political parties in the White House every 8 years, even when nobody will admit that is the case.

AKA people that saw big gains want out for them profits, just like you do.  Then all the Appl-diots that wanted in for the split gonna panic sale, price dips lower.  Then the smart long apple players buy back in, bringing it back up to an appropriate growth price, a stability point.  $495 in this case.  It's going to fuck around $495 till power hour.  Then we might see some more buying in.  It'll creep up towards $500 throughout the week, gaining about a dollar or two a day.  Friday it might take off, might not, depends on the rest of the market. The stock went from $386 to near $500 in a week.  It's not going to die, it's not going to bottom out.  It's going to keep doing what it does.  The little engine that could.  Shit or get off the pot, it's going to be around for a long time.

FB EOD predictions? I'm hoping for 283.
I think there is still hype in AAPL and TSLA especially once split occurs. I speculated that they are trading sideways is most likely due to JPow talking on Thursday and no one wants to make any major move.
They started the DDs way back when it was around $12/share I think? If you had bought in then or all the way up to the beginning of July you‚Äôd still be profitable. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a PnD but it‚Äôs definitely overvalued and makes no sense to hold in the current economic situation.

I was actually lucky because I had had a straddle and during the time when I first tried to sell, and when I called CS and had them sell it flipped from one side making me a profit, to the other way around. So I only lost a $1000 from my gains, but still gained $2400 on that particular trade. It is very frustrating. They said to me that I could file a claim that they would then do research and change things if they found enough evidence, but I was afraid they might work the other way and make me lose money, so I just stopped there."

"Elon, it's almost time to do the thing."
"Nobody thinks XOM is going to find a new revenue stream. It's old school oil and natural gas. XOM is bleeding profit--down 70% in two years. XOM posted its first quarterly loss in decades. The global economy has slowed down and people need less energy. Increasingly, people are looking to renewables for electricity generation. Battery technology is improving at a fast pace, meaning that oil's portability doesn't matter as much anymore. XOM is an old dinosaur that knows how to do one thing well, but that one thing matters less and less every year. Nobody is going to invest in XOM because they expect innovation. A long term bet on XOM is really a long term bet on the price of oil."

The reason they were added to the Dow is because of Apple's split. It's a price weighed index so that hurts it a lot. I think that might have been discussed and seems extremely unlikely.

Just because it looks like a pump and dump doesn't mean it is one. I urge you to read their financial statements."

"I really don't know if they show that or not based on what I can see on my phone. Either way, obviously I'm happy to have gotten so far above my limit. I'm always wanting to understand more about how all this works and so I thought it would be interesting to see what factors are in play. Either way, it marked a transaction at well above the very highest price of the day so far and it just seemed odd to me why a lower beard didn't print for whoever had an order in.

At any rate, I appreciate everybody's input. It sounds like it's impossible to know exactly why that happened but it would have had to consist of a buyer either setting a very high limit by or sending a market order that for whatever reason the market maker system ended up charging him that very high price. I'm glad it happened of course LOL"
"I concur, haha. üòÅüí∞ü§ûüèº"
I‚Äôm definitely a moomer (millennial boomer). I remember the days of a ‚Äúfree‚Äù internet and believe me it was better than now.
One of the main reason I am all in is because there will be a day when because of the Sales Orders they will announce a double shift. Whenever that day comes everyone's earnings model will be turned upside down. A NIO stock that is $17 may look to go towards $25. The 100 million plus shorts will accelerate the move up. So you must be prepared to take the temporary hit on Covertible Shares under that scenario. Just my thoughts Thanks for yours

This is the correct answer. I always sell covered calls but I know there is a way to do this that I‚Äôve never done. But I‚Äôm scared after getting burned a few weeks ago so now I sell aapl calls at like 640 and just collect a little bit each week.

PSTG is reporting earnings tonight.  I am going to hold it.  I believe we either go to 20 or come back down to 15.

I think STOR hits 30+ after they report earnings this quarter. They will show that they have been collecting rents and companies are working to re-open.  It is counter-intuitive with all the business closing. 

Started a position in WYNN.  It has run up a few dollars and I believe it is good for a trade up to 90.  WYNN is starting to get conference bookings for Jan.  this is a very important indicator for all hotels and travel.  This is a great sign but they are booking these conferences with no cancelation fees.  Covid has to become less of an issue by the end of the year for companies to keep these conferences.  For now, we are going in the right direction.

What's weird is that Robinhood is letting me sell those call options again at higher bid price and it's asking me again to put 400 shares as collateral. Just curious how is that possible since I only own 400 shares which were already put as collateral when I sold mh first four call options?"

HCAC and HCACW with the nice bounce today.
Would love to know what fucking chart you‚Äôre looking at
"Ok , my analysis will come later, but COMEX is a commodities exchange. It deals almost exclusively with precious metals and energy. Futures contracts are like paper (contract) buying physical items through an agreement. Their purpose is to control supply/demand and price fluctuations. All those Silver Eagles people are buying and selling come from a distributor, but that distributor must get the raw materials from a miner or bank ( like JPM). If they get it from a miner, it's usually done through a futures contract on a commodities exchange like COMEX.  In order for JPM or COMEX to sell  a contract they theoretically **actually** are supposed to have the quantities stored somewhere in storage. If they cannot meet the demand silver goes up because admitting to a shortage automatically  increases the cost b/c of supply and demand. They would also be guilty of fraud so that's even worse since they are international. It won't be a Kodak situation.

JPM is the custodian of the SLV ETF, meaning they are similar to COMEX in that they theoretically have the assets (physical silver) to cover the contracts/stock they sell with one exception being you and I are not actually buying physical metal. With a futures contract on COMEX some distributor of SLV is paying for actual physical silver to be delivered to them. If you notice on the ETF it has a settlement date of 1 Sep. Anytime you see settlement in securities it means ""actual date something (stock, funds, items) arrives"". On Sept 1 , JPM has to deliver silver to whomever placed an order to buy actual silver. 

As this relates to JPow, he is in a tough pickle. He either must let deflation (weakening dollar) run rampant, or try to convince people inflation is good. Both scenarios aid GLD and SLV as that  their actual purpose is to  hedge against global currency depreciation.  Silver has industrial uses that aren't relevant per se to the upcoming speech, but b/c GLD and SLV are married to one another in that if gold goes up, silver must follow. Thus, JPows speech is a Gold and Silver catalyst :D! 

**TL'DR** Silver goes up b/c of demand and JPow admitting to a weakening economy."

"Cmon do you know how routing order flow works? MM are DMMs on certain exchanges. So if like the entire NASDAQ block of exchanges are shut down, the DMM on that exchange loses a chunk of order flow. That's NASDAQ and PHLX which are 2 of the largest. MIAX might be limited too. The MM can still trade on BATO sure but since it's not the DMM, he doesn't get order priority...which changes the order flow and thus the supply/demand

I worked at SIG as an intern...I know how PFOF and routing for order flow works. You sound like you seem to know this stuff lol...this is how Citadel gets so much flow from RH. They have priority on certain exchanges as the DMM + PFOF combination."

"If you‚Äôre holding the 16c and out of day trades you can write the 16.5 call and it‚Äôll drastically reduce your delta and theta exposure, allowing you to lock in profits. Then you can close out both positions the next day"
"Usually when a platform goes down, the phone lines get slammed, but they will put through orders over the phone with their system. But OP complains about having lost thousands over just 5 minutes, and realistically a broker will not be able to enter an order over the phone in less than 5 minutes. OP was way overleveraged, and was going to lose big from volatility eventually, especially from Tesla's volatility.

A conditional order set would at least have an order pending on TDA's back end in case the front-end platform goes down. If their back end goes down nothing will help you, you just have to wait. It would definitely reduce your risk of the front-end going down. However that adds a new risk--if the front end goes down it's possible you can't cancel your conditional order while it's down.

I no longer ever place trades I'm not willing to sit on for at least several days."

ELI5 why RKT is definitely going to $50
Probably til around 9/10ish
Good thing I sold at the top
If a stock is going up but my put is also going up does that just mean alot of people are hedging on the stock dropping? So is that a good thing or bad?
Do your own research
I saw it spiked like 50 cents and I was like hm maybe I should get it and then I looked away and it was up $25
"Same here. My 9/4 515 Calls were in the money and my buddy was trying to convince me not to sell. In that 10 minutes I lost a huge chunk of profits before I sold, then he convinced me to buy back in at the end of the day at a lower premium and most of my profits are toast lol."

"It's called a written complaint. A phone bank, series 24, 30 year old is not the last line. Firms have customer care departments that are not the contact center. They are required to respond to a written complaint. Furthermore, complaints tied to financial loss are that much more severe.

Edit. I would also include in the letter that you expressed your verbal complaint to the ""manager"" in the phone center and he did not escalate the matter. Likely will get him in deep shit because as a series 24, it's basically his job to facilitate compliance issues like complaints. He manages the people in the phone center, not the firms resolution process."

Compared to casinos, they got their platform created earlier and really had strong  marketing to pull in fantasy football and create a new genre of daily fantasy sports, so maybe a lot of their success is early capture of that market. Once casinos copy them, and potentially do it better, maybe all bets are off... as they say."

i have checked out insta's of some hotties though, and i get the advertising appeal.

they have a bunch of followers, which means those people like the person they're following, which means whatever products they are seen using, the followers will go out and buy those products

having a checkout right there on the instagram page, will make the sales seamless, and direct. buyers will be more likely to buy because it's quicker. advertisers may pay more if their sales numbers improve after FB adds the checkouts

i would imagine this would lead to increased earnings for FB, and therefore a higher stock price

"reposting my comment from yesterdays earnings thread:

 

I think you can make a case that a move to WFH had people go out and buy printers and ink... maybe?? But many of the other printer companies have already reported very weak printing numbers. HP probably has some of the most exposure to consumer printing, but still I think we are looking at a shitty quarter for HPQ

&gt;\*""\****Printing company results weak all round.***  
*Xerox reported Jun-Q revenue of $1.5bn (-35% Y/Y in constant currency, vs. -14% in Q1), missing FactSet consensus by 1%. Management said it expects a slow, gradual recovery in the second half of the year.*  
*Canon reported Q2 revenue of JPY673bn (-26% Y/Y, vs. -10% in Q1), missing consensus by 9%. Canon also noted that it is expecting a slow recovery in H2.*  
*Ricoh reported FQ1 (Jun-Q) revenue of JPY352bn (-26% Y/Y vs. -2% Y/Y in Mar-Q), missing consensus by 10%. Management called out that office attendance rates and print volumes recovered after bottoming out in April and May.*  
*Epson reported FQ1 revenue of JPY193bn (-23% Y/Y, vs. -5% in the Mar-Q), missing consensus by 11%. Management called supply shortages due to COVID which it expects will persist in H2.*

HP laptops suck, no IT departments are spending on equipment except for maybe some WFH stuff - all signs point to weak Q.

I don't have any positions in HPQ - if I did would look to buy a 8/28 $17P"

Everyone knows they are going to blow out earnings. Why wouldn't the stock pop after earnings?
I have done a bit of research and most of consensus looks to be a weaker dollar and higher metals. Especially with inflation target raised. So wondering if downfall is due to people thinking powell won't lift inflation target or for other reasons.

I wonder if he would have a better chance if he had a conditional trade set up ahead of time and that platform had the error?

NIO CALLS ARE PRINTING!!
You have to account for what type of research you're doing. Are you looking into a company's financials and comparing it with their stock price/PE/market cap? Do you want to go down a rabbit hole of conspiracies? If so then do it on a company that has a bad financials but have had big spikes in volumes due to insider info etc. If you wanna do one on how coronavirus affected industries pick like airlines/travel etc. If you wanna just have solid fundamentals pick a blue chip stock. If you wanna dive deeper into how the government plays a role in the companies pick defense stocks (Boeing (BA) is part of the defense contracts if you didn't know already).
Look for engulfing green candles on volume

"The same can be said for Tesla at 1400, Apple at 420, Amazon at 2000 or 2500. I thought people were idiots buying calls on SPY at 325. I see no reason why Facebook won‚Äôt push 300 by October especially with Instagram Reels possibly taking over the same space that Tik Tom held."

YCC fights inflation if my econ isn't failing me now. It also caps the yield curve so you can get stuck in negative real interest rates. (Inflation adjusted interest rates). With negative rates people flock to precious metals because they hold value and are a hedge against inflation

It will. People who say otherwise are clueless retards.
"LULU broke 380 way ahead of schedule.  I've been super bullish, and this is awesome.  We'll hit 390s next week and maybe even 400s ahead of earnings (last time it cracked 300s leading up to earnings hype, which it flopped, and now it's up like $100/share from when it crashed before announcing the Mirror acquisition).

Very excited to make \~4k this week from my calls &amp; spreads, and then we'll roll it into next week to hopefully make \~10k.

Earnings is 9/8 AH.  Gonna be holding very little into the earnings call b/c it will be a gamble.  LULU has flopped 3 times in a row after earnings calls.  Super risky to gamble on them turning it around this time around.  Q3 call in December will be \*very different\*.

However, if LULU announces an split like I'm thinking they might, it'll hit $500 pre-split like Apple due to its 90% institutional ownership.  I'd love to see an 8-1 split, but it'll probably be closer to 4 or 5."

"No I don‚Äôt. Because retail traders aren‚Äôt buying stocks. Options are selling more than stocks and that‚Äôs never happened in the history of the market until now. If you want to make money on options, pick closer strikes. In my opinion you‚Äôre basically setting money on fire for a what if. You realize the percentage gain Apple would have to have for that to even be close to in the money? You forgot to factor in people who are going to profit take, and you‚Äôre also trading off of pure speculation. Apple announces new phones. That‚Äôs either going to make or break you, but might as well buy closer strikes so you can get out with minimal damage or you can make great money IF what you‚Äôre predicting will happen happens. At this point I‚Äôd get out if I were you."

"It was implied through their earnings call that this is the case.  Management has weakness I agree, but that's because there's no financially directive board members, they're nearly all scientists.  This is why there tends to be a lack in PR's because they overthink how to send out a PR, they have a harder time deciding how to vaguely convey information rather than direct info.  You can hear this for yourself literally in every audio PR they've been on.  Thousands die every day to begin with, get a reality check on yourself here.  Rushing to conclusions gets you burned, the management here knows that and is likely why they don't PR often.  They do not want people to rush to make an incorrect assumption.  Go invest in Moderna and the other vax companies if you want a PR every day for 2 years to pump the price while in the background it fails to meet realistic standards and ethics practices."

Vix shoots up 3% on the slightest red candlesticks on the indices because everyone knows this market is balancing on a needles edge.
"The problem here is that a good part of the CA loss is already priced in from Q2 earnings call. Uber took a -79% hit to bookings across the board for ridesharing from COVID, which is only partially offset by the Uber Eats increases. This ridesharing thwack is expected to continue in Q3 for both companies with recovery following similar paths.

Lyft doesn't have a LyftEats (tm), so their hit is not offset at all.  However, Lyft's Q2 loss was -$250M to Uber's -$837M, and was \~7% or so less than Uber's Q-Q loss (approximately, I'm having trouble comparing the two presentations).  And, Lyft just doesn't have as many costs as Uber's side businesses have, and spends more time picking it's growth opportunities.

Bottomline, it'll drop but not by as much as you think. Yes, CA would be a major loss, but COVID has already dropped bookings across the board. Recovery is impacted, but Q3 was already planned to still be in-recovery. That will give them time to present and refine a new model without it being doomsday."

The u/indonesian_activist guy has some pretty solid anti-PRPL information and even he agrees that they're growth and marketing is solid.


I dont see them dropping below 18 by October, and still likely back up to 25ish by EoY. The hype was overplayed, and correction is in place. Sucks for the derps that bought naked calls, but the same thing can be said for plenty of other WSB hype trains. Just surprising to me how much hate PRPL got in comparison to plenty of other mis-calls on here. Especially when the biggest promoters of it were promoting SAFE plays that made money. Hell, I even got greedier than they suggested and still made money."

Double Edit: Ok. I just took a look at the purple mattress. It is literally that $100 tpe grid on top of a foam mattress. Here's a purple mattress without the fabric (this is from their marketing video) [https://assets.purple.com/images/PDP-Purple-Mat.jpg?mtime=20190923134538](https://assets.purple.com/images/PDP-Purple-Mat.jpg?mtime=20190923134538)

Compare that to what they're selling for $100 on alibaba. Once that gets on Amazon, Purple is toast.

you will still get the split. i believe the record date is only certain occasions like dividends and shit.
I have 2 x 530c 9/11 that i‚Äôm holding. Up 113% still so i‚Äôm not too worried. Should go up post split and i think they‚Äôre unveiling the new iphone on the 10th so we‚Äôre gucci.

It's normal for a split not to effect the price action at all.

Stefanie Link says she can't justify the Nvidia valuation but will stay in it. That in a nutshell sums up most investment managers. Sheep.
Up 100% on my two contracts.  BigC $90C jan/2021 and BigC $110C April/2021.  Probably should have bought one more contract this morning instead of being a retard and buying Tsla weeklies ATH

"Nobody went to the moon until someone did. As JFK put it:

We choose to short TSLA. We choose to short TSLA in this month and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last week to shift our efforts in TSLA from long to short gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Autistry."

"Missed the boat on BABA after taking a loss on earnings. Pretty salty, I wanted to buy LEAPS but most of my capital is tied up in covered calls until September 18. Lesson learned, keep cash on hand for when things seem irrational. **What are your views on BABA Jan 2022 upside?** Still enough juice?

**What are your thoughts on WMT?** I still think WMT Jan 2022s will be money. COVID is just a consolidator of capital towards the companies big enough to survive / thrive regardless of economic / pandemic conditions. Wealth consolidation towards those in higher $$$ brackets will also mean more people getting squeezed out of the middle class, and increased traffic through depression-resistant / more economical businesses like Walmart, dollar tree, Etc. Plus, decreased competition from all the business not large enough to survive (which I think we have not necessarily seen the worst of yet). I also think their continued expansion into eCommerce will be fruitful going forward. 

WMT Catalysts: Walmart+, continuing strategic investments in technology, macroeconomic conditions. 

What are your thoughts?"

They have an event being held next Monday, 9/1, there should be a slight runup at the end of this week and also because of the jpow announcement on Thursday. 

If you‚Äôre that strapped for cash I‚Äôd probably sell that on Friday late in the afternoon if the runup does occur. If you believe their event on Monday will drive the stock up more, sell early next week. Theta is going to crush you in the coming weeks. Goodluck."

"Well I'm talking high yield savings like the 8 percent rates in the 1990's and the close to 3 percent before Powell and co cut rates.

The issue with having everyone in assets and equities is that they're fleeting. If you continue to pile in cash into those (what's happening now) those valuations are going to hold as people get antsy and sell for cash to pay for everyday stuff. 

As for property you run the real risk of a magna Carta situation if everyone becomes a landlord. Houses are built for people to live not for obsence gains. The latter has taken hold in the last few decades but there could be a moment when the poor just legit walk into people's homes and tell them this is mine now."

Well boys it appears kang gang has returned.
Buy a house as rates are lowest they have ever been and we are going to see asset inflation as a result of the Fed printing. Carry as little debt as possible outside mortgage. Buy physical gold when you have extra cash on hand and just stash it. Max out Roth IRA for boring long term investments while you satisfy your degeneracy buying options in a separate account. Drink lots of water. Use some drugs and explore your consciousness but don‚Äôt get addicted to anything. If you are even the tiniest bit unsure if you should be with your girlfriend/boyfriend get the fuck out and find a bad bitch who is as down as you are. Don‚Äôt marry unless you have zero doubts whatsoever and are madly in love. Get that bread while you are young because compound interest is the only actual magic that exists in this world.
We will honor your sacrifice

"Can I has some confirmation bias help for TSLA puts?

I literally never see Teslas on the roads and I live in a major, relatively wealthy metro area.

Plus would folks that bought TSLA for, say 1k, not sell now for 100% profit? Not even mentioning those who bought it at $200-300."

Ambitious. I like that.
"First, you should probably understand how bond etfs, bond yields, and bond prices work. If you're betting on the price of HYG going down, what bet are you inherently placing on the price and yield of the underlying bonds?

Second, you should identify the stakeholders in high yield bonds. What bonds does the etf track? Who else is holding these bonds, and why did the fed start buying them in the first place? Was this move by the fed precedented? 

If you do a bit more digging and can answer those questions while still remaining confident in this play, I'd say go for it lol."

You're right but I was desperate for low premium because I lost a LOT on silver and wanted to get it back. I'll likely roll it over if its still looking good a few weeks from now.

"Im not a mortgage specialized by any means, but with their past record is hard to argue. They are scaled pretty well right now as the #1 online mortgage provider. As more millennial are looking towards this market, they are likely to be the first source. They do well on the follow up as well. Once they have deals with brokerages as well, it will be a no brainer. A sales team or a biz dev division should be able to help drag that scale."
